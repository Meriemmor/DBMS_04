# DBMS_04 – Normalization in Practice: From Plain Text to DDL

**Module:** Databases · THGA Bochum  
**Lecturer:** Stephan Bökelmann · <sboekelmann@ep1.rub.de>  
**Repository:** <https://github.com/MaxClerkwell/DBMS_04>  
**Prerequisites:** DBMS_01, DBMS_02, DBMS_03, Lecture 04 (Normalization)  
**Duration:** 90 minutes

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this exercise you will be able to:

- Translate a natural-language problem description into a **flat starting table**
- Systematically identify and write down **functional dependencies**
- Decompose the table step by step into **2NF** and **3NF**, verifying losslessness at each step
- Represent the normalized schema as a **PlantUML diagram**
- Implement the schema as **DDL** in SQLite and populate it with sample data
- Formulate three practical **SQL queries** that directly reflect relational algebra

**After completing this exercise you should be able to answer the following questions independently:**

- How do I recognize a partial or transitive dependency in a real table?
- Why is a decomposition only correct if it is lossless?
- When is 3NF sufficient — and when do I need BCNF?

## 1 – The Starting Point: A Workshop and Its Spreadsheet

A small car repair workshop has been managing its repair orders in a single
Excel spreadsheet for years. Each row describes one **work item** within an
order — a single task assigned to a mechanic. The table looks like this
(simplified):

| OrderNo | Date       | CustNo | CustName        | CustCity | Plate       | Make | Model | Year | MechId | MechName   | HourlyRate | ItemNo | Description         | Hours |
|---------|------------|--------|-----------------|----------|-------------|------|-------|------|--------|------------|------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| 1001    | 2026-03-10 | K01    | Berger, Franz   | Bochum   | BO-AB 123   | VW   | Golf  | 2018 | M03    | Huber, Tom | 65.00      | 1      | Oil change          | 0.5   |
| 1001    | 2026-03-10 | K01    | Berger, Franz   | Bochum   | BO-AB 123   | VW   | Golf  | 2018 | M03    | Huber, Tom | 65.00      | 2      | Replace air filter  | 0.3   |
| 1002    | 2026-03-11 | K02    | Novak, Jana     | Herne    | HER-XY 44   | Ford | Focus | 2020 | M01    | Schulz, P. | 60.00      | 1      | Front brake pads    | 1.5   |
| 1003    | 2026-03-12 | K01    | Berger, Franz   | Bochum   | BO-CD 999   | BMW  | 320i  | 2019 | M03    | Huber, Tom | 65.00      | 1      | Service inspection  | 2.0   |
| 1003    | 2026-03-12 | K01    | Berger, Franz   | Bochum   | BO-CD 999   | BMW  | 320i  | 2019 | M01    | Schulz, P. | 60.00      | 2      | Tyre change         | 0.8   |

The primary key of this flat table is `(OrderNo, ItemNo)` — every combination
of order number and item number appears exactly once.

### Task 1a – Identify Anomalies

Read the table carefully and describe one concrete example of each:

1. **Update anomaly:** Which rows would need to be changed simultaneously if
   mechanic Huber raises his hourly rate to 70.00?
2. **Insert anomaly:** Can a new mechanic be added before they work on their
   first order? What is missing?
3. **Delete anomaly:** What information is permanently lost if order 1002 is
   deleted entirely?

> "updates anomaly":If  the mechanic  raises his hourly rate to 70.00, rows 1, 2, and 4 must all be updated simultaneously.

 >"insert anomaly":A new mechanic cannot be added before they work on their first order  because MechId, MechName, and HourlyRate only exist as part of a row that requires a valid OrderNo and ItemNo .

>"delete anomaly":If order 1002 is deleted, all information about the customer Novak, Jana   will be permanently lost since she only appears once in the third row.

### Task 1b – Write Down Functional Dependencies

List all non-trivial functional dependencies you can identify in the flat table.
Use the notation $X \rightarrow Y$.

Hints:
- Which attributes uniquely determine the customer?
- Which attributes follow from the licence plate alone?
- What does a single mechanic ID determine?
- What only follows from the combination `(OrderNo, ItemNo)`?

FD1: CustNo       : CustName, CustCity
FD2: Plate        : Make, Model, Year, CustNo
FD3: MechId       : MechName, HourlyRate
FD4: OrderNo      : Date, CustNo, Plate
FD5: (OrderNo, ItemNo) : MechId, Description, Hours
### Questions for Task 1

**Question 1.1:** Is `CustNo → CustCity` a *full* or *partial* dependency with
respect to the primary key `(OrderNo, ItemNo)`? Justify your answer using the
definition from Lecture 04.

> Using the exact definition from Handout 04:"Ein Attribut A hängt partiell von einem Schlüssel K ab, wenn eine echte Teilmenge K′ ⊊ K existiert mit K′ → A". That means CustNo → CustCity is a partial dependency with respect to (OrderNo, ItemNo) which is the primary key.To find a customer's city, you only need OrderNo — you don't need ItemNo at all. Since only part of the primary key (OrderNo, ItemNo) is needed, this is a partial dependency.

**Question 1.2:** Identify a transitive dependency in the flat table and explain
why it violates 3NF.

> OrderNo → CustNo → CustCity is a transitive dependency.
OrderNo determines CustNo, and CustNo determines CustCity. So CustCity depends on the key through CustNo which violates 3NF because CustNo is not a superkey.

**Question 1.3:** Compute the attribute closure $\{\mathrm{OrderNo}\}^+$ using
your FD list. Is `OrderNo` alone a superkey of the flat table?

> {OrderNo}⁺ = {OrderNo, Date, CustNo, Plate, CustName, CustCity, Make, Model, Year}
OrderNo is not a superkey because ItemNo, MechId, MechName, HourlyRate, Description, and Hours are missing. A superkey must determine every attribute in the table.

---

## 2 – Normalization

### Task 2a – Decompose into 2NF

All attributes that depend only partially on the primary key `(OrderNo, ItemNo)`
must be moved into separate relations. Work out the decomposition on paper first,
then fill in the table below.

**Result (fill in):**

| Relation       | Attributes                                         | Primary Key            |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `customer`     | `cust_no`, `cust_name`, `cust_city`               | `cust_no`              |
| `vehicle`      | `plate`, `make`, `model`, `year`, `cust_no`       | `plate`                |
| `mechanic`     | `mech_id`, `mech_name`, `hourly_rate`             | `mech_id`              |
| `order`        | `order_no`, `date`, `plate`, `cust_no`            | `order_no`             |
| `work_item`    | `order_no`, `item_no`, `mech_id`, `description`, `hours` | `(order_no, item_no)` |

Check: In every relation, does each non-key attribute depend on the **complete**
primary key?

> customer: cust_name and cust_city depend only on cust_no ✔️

>vehicle: make, model, year, cust_no depend only on plate ✔️


>mechanic: mech_name and hourly_rate depend only on mech_id ✔️

>order: date, plate, cust_no depend only on order_no ✔️

>work_item: mech_id, description, hours depend on the full (order_no, item_no) — neither order_no nor item_no alone is enough

### Task 2b – Decompose into 3NF

Examine `order` and `vehicle` for transitive dependencies.

- In `order`: does `cust_no` depend directly on `order_no`? Does `cust_name`
  transitively depend on it through `cust_no`? *(After the 2NF split,
  `cust_name` should already be in `customer` — verify that this is correct.)*
- In `vehicle`: is there a dependency between `plate` and `cust_no` that
  requires a further split, or is `vehicle` already in 3NF?

State your conclusion: are all five relations from Task 2a already in 3NF?
If not, perform the missing decomposition.

> order table:
cust_name is already in the customer table — not in order. So there is no transitive dependency in order. cust_no depends directly on order_no ✓
vehicle table:
plate determines cust_no, and all other attributes (make, model, year) depend directly on plate. There is no transitive chain, so vehicle is already in 3NF ✓
Conclusion:
All five relations from Task 2a are already in 3NF. No further decomposition is needed.

### Task 2c – Verify Losslessness

Pick one of the decompositions you performed (e.g. the split of the original
table into `order` and `vehicle`) and verify it using the **Heath criterion**:

$$R_1 \cap R_2 \rightarrow R_1 \setminus R_2 \quad \text{or} \quad R_1 \cap R_2 \rightarrow R_2 \setminus R_1$$

Name the shared attributes, state the FD you rely on, and conclude whether the
decomposition is lossless.

>I verified the split of the flat table into order and vehicle.

Shared attribute (R₁ ∩ R₂): plate
FD used: plate → make, model, year, cust_no
Since plate determines all attributes that are only in vehicle, the Heath criterion is satisfied:

R₁ ∩ R₂ → R₂ \ R₁ ✓
Conclusion: The decomposition is lossless — joining order and vehicle on plate always reconstructs the original data exactly, with no phantom rows added.

### Questions for Task 2

**Question 2.1:** Why must `cust_no` remain as a foreign key in `order` even
though the customer is also reachable via the vehicle's licence plate?
Describe a realistic scenario where the direct link `order → customer` is
necessary.

> A vehicle can change owners. If a customer sells their car, vehicle.cust_no gets updated to the new owner. Without a direct cust_no in order, we would lose track of who actually placed each past order.
Realistic scenario:
Berger sells his BMW to a new owner. The new owner brings the same car (BO-CD 999) in for a repair. Now vehicle.cust_no points to the new owner — but the old order 1003 should still belong to Berger.

**Question 2.2:** Is the schema after the 3NF decomposition also in BCNF?
Justify your answer using the definition: for every non-trivial FD $X \rightarrow Y$,
$X$ must be a superkey.

> In the order table, plate → cust_no holds — but plate is not a superkey of order . This concludes that the schema is in 3NF but not in BCNF..

**Question 2.3:** The hourly rate of a mechanic is stored in `mechanic`. If a
mechanic changes their rate during the year, what problem arises for already
completed orders? How could the schema be extended to correctly record
historical hourly rates?

> If a mechanic changes their hourly rate, all past orders will show the new rate when joining with the mechanic table — not the rate that applied at the time of the work. This means all the old billing data becomes incorrect.The solution is to store the hourly rate directly in work_item at the time of booking, or add a rate history table.

## 3 – Schema Diagram

### Task 3a – Create the PlantUML File

Create `schema.puml` in the repository directory:

```bash
vim schema.puml
```

> If you have never used Vim, run `vimtutor` in your terminal first — a
> self-contained 30-minute interactive lesson. The essential commands:
> - `i` — enter Insert mode (you can type)
> - `Esc` — return to Normal mode
> - `:w` — save the file
> - `:wq` — save and quit
> - `:q!` — quit without saving

Transfer your normalized schema into PlantUML IE notation. Use the following
skeleton and add the missing attributes and relationships according to your
result from Task 2:

```plantuml
@startuml
!define PK <b><color:gold>PK</color></b>
!define FK <i><color:gray>FK</color></i>

entity customer {
    PK cust_no    : INTEGER
    --
    cust_name     : TEXT
    cust_city     : TEXT
}

entity vehicle {
    PK plate      : TEXT
    --
    FK cust_no    : INTEGER
    make          : TEXT
    model         : TEXT
    year          : INTEGER
}

entity mechanic {
    PK mech_id    : INTEGER
    --
    mech_name     : TEXT
    hourly_rate   : REAL
}

entity order {
    PK order_no   : INTEGER
    --
    FK plate      : TEXT
    FK cust_no    : INTEGER
    date          : DATE
}

entity work_item {
    PK FK order_no : INTEGER
    PK item_no     : INTEGER
    --
    FK mech_id     : INTEGER
    description    : TEXT
    hours          : REAL
}

' Add relationship lines here:
' customer    ||--o{ vehicle    : "owns"
' ...

@enduml
```

Add the missing relationship lines. Every foreign key relationship needs one
line. PlantUML IE multiplicity notation:

| Notation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `\|\|` | exactly one |
| `o{` | zero or many |
| `\|{` | one or many |
| `o\|` | zero or one |

### Task 3b – Render and Review

```bash
plantuml -tsvg schema.puml
```

Open `schema.svg` in a browser and check:
- Are all five entities visible?
- Does every foreign key relationship show the correct multiplicity?
- Are PK and FK correctly marked?

If you are working on the student server, copy the file to your local machine first:

```bash
scp <username>@<server>:/path/to/DBMS_04/schema.svg ~/Downloads/schema.svg
```

> **Screenshot 2:** Take a screenshot showing the rendered diagram with all
> five entities and their relationships.

### Task 3c – Commit

```bash
git add schema.puml
echo "schema.svg" >> .gitignore
echo "*.db"       >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "docs: normalized schema diagram for workshop management"
```

---

## 4 – DDL: Implement the Schema in SQLite

### Task 4a – Write schema.sql

```bash
vim schema.sql
```

Write `CREATE TABLE` statements for all five relations. Requirements:

- Every table must have an explicit `PRIMARY KEY` constraint.
- Every foreign key must be declared with `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` actions —
  choose the most restrictive action that is still domain-correct.
- `work_item.hours` must be greater than zero: `CHECK (hours > 0)`.
- `mechanic.hourly_rate` must also be greater than zero.
- Use SQLite types only (`INTEGER`, `TEXT`, `REAL`, `DATE`).

<details>
<summary>Solution skeleton — try it yourself first</summary>

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

CREATE TABLE customer (
    cust_no   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_name TEXT    NOT NULL,
    cust_city TEXT    NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE vehicle (
    plate    TEXT    PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_no  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    make     TEXT    NOT NULL,
    model    TEXT    NOT NULL,
    year     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_no) REFERENCES customer(cust_no)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE mechanic (
    mech_id     INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    mech_name   TEXT    NOT NULL,
    hourly_rate REAL    NOT NULL CHECK (hourly_rate > 0)
);

    cust_no  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    date     DATE    NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (plate)   REFERENCES vehicle(plate)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_no) REFERENCES customer(cust_no)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE work_item (
    order_no    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    item_no     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    mech_id     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    description TEXT    NOT NULL,
    hours       REAL    NOT NULL CHECK (hours > 0),
    PRIMARY KEY (order_no, item_no),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_no) REFERENCES "order"(order_no)
        ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (mech_id)  REFERENCES mechanic(mech_id)
        ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

> Note: `order` is a reserved word in SQL. It must be quoted with double quotes
> in SQLite, or you rename the table to `repair_order` to avoid the conflict
> entirely — which is often the cleaner choice in practice.

### Task 4b – Load the Schema and Verify

```bash
sqlite3 workshop.db < schema.sql
sqlite3 workshop.db ".tables"
```

> You should see: `customer  mechanic  order  vehicle  work_item`

> **Screenshot 3:** Take a screenshot showing the `.tables` output.

### Task 4c – Insert Sample Data

```bash
vim data.sql
```

Insert the data from the flat table in Section 1, now split across the five
normalized relations. Start with the tables that have no foreign keys
(`customer`, `mechanic`), then `vehicle`, then `order`, and finally `work_item`.

<details>
<summary>Sample data — try it yourself first</summary>

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;

-- Customers
INSERT INTO customer VALUES (1, 'Berger, Franz', 'Bochum');
INSERT INTO customer VALUES (2, 'Novak, Jana',   'Herne');

-- Mechanics
INSERT INTO mechanic VALUES (1, 'Schulz, P.', 60.00);
INSERT INTO mechanic VALUES (3, 'Huber, Tom', 65.00);

-- Vehicles
INSERT INTO vehicle VALUES ('BO-AB 123', 1, 'VW',   'Golf',  2018);
INSERT INTO vehicle VALUES ('HER-XY 44', 2, 'Ford', 'Focus', 2020);
INSERT INTO vehicle VALUES ('BO-CD 999', 1, 'BMW',  '320i',  2019);

-- Orders
INSERT INTO "order" VALUES (1001, 'BO-AB 123', 1, '2026-03-10');
INSERT INTO "order" VALUES (1002, 'HER-XY 44', 2, '2026-03-11');
INSERT INTO "order" VALUES (1003, 'BO-CD 999', 1, '2026-03-12');

-- Work items
INSERT INTO work_item VALUES (1001, 1, 3, 'Oil change',         0.5);
INSERT INTO work_item VALUES (1001, 2, 3, 'Replace air filter', 0.3);
INSERT INTO work_item VALUES (1002, 1, 1, 'Front brake pads',   1.5);
INSERT INTO work_item VALUES (1003, 1, 3, 'Service inspection', 2.0);
INSERT INTO work_item VALUES (1003, 2, 1, 'Tyre change',        0.8);
```

</details>

```bash
sqlite3 workshop.db < data.sql
```

Verify the row counts:

```sql
SELECT 'customer',  COUNT(*) FROM customer
UNION ALL SELECT 'mechanic',  COUNT(*) FROM mechanic
UNION ALL SELECT 'vehicle',   COUNT(*) FROM vehicle
UNION ALL SELECT 'order',     COUNT(*) FROM "order"
UNION ALL SELECT 'work_item', COUNT(*) FROM work_item;
```

> Expected: 2, 2, 3, 3, 5.

Commit:

```bash
git add schema.sql data.sql
git commit -m "feat: DDL and sample data for normalized workshop schema"
```

### Questions for Task 4

**Question 4.1:** `ON DELETE CASCADE` was chosen for the foreign key
`work_item.order_no`, but `ON DELETE RESTRICT` for `vehicle.cust_no`.
Justify both choices in terms of the domain — what does it mean for the
business if an order is deleted versus if a customer is deleted?

> ON DELETE CASCADE for work_item.order_no: when an order is deleted, its work items have no meaning without it, so they should be deleted automatically.

>ON DELETE RESTRICT for vehicle.cust_no: a customer should not be deleted while they still own a vehicle in the database because it would destroy very important records.


**Question 4.2:** Test referential integrity by running:

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
INSERT INTO work_item VALUES (9999, 1, 3, 'Ghost item', 1.0);
```

What error do you get? What does this tell you about the difference between
a constraint declared in DDL and one that is actually enforced at runtime?

> This is the error i got:Runtime error: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed (19). This tells me that declaring a constraint in DDL is not enough. SQLite only enforces foreign keys when PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON is explicitly set at runtime.

**Question 4.3:** Test the CHECK constraint:

```sql
INSERT INTO work_item VALUES (1001, 3, 3, 'Invalid', -0.5);
```

What happens? What would happen if the CHECK constraint were missing?

> i got the error CHECK constraint failed: hours > 0 (19). Without the CHECK constraint, -0.5 would be silently stored, leading to incorrect billing calculations.

---

## 5 – SQL Queries

Save all three queries in a file called `queries.sql`. Write a short comment
before each query describing its purpose.

### Task 5a – All Work Items for a Given Customer

**Task:** List all order numbers, order dates, licence plates, item descriptions,
and hours for customer `Berger, Franz`, ordered by date and item number.

Write the relational algebra expression first (in words or formal notation),
then the SQL query.

```sql
1001|2026-03-10|BO-AB 123|Oil change|0.5
1001|2026-03-10|BO-AB 123|Replace air filter|0.3
1003|2026-03-12|BO-CD 999|Service inspection|2.0
1003|2026-03-12|BO-CD 999|Tyre change|0.8

```

<details>
<summary>Expected result</summary>

Four rows: two items from order 1001 (Golf, 2026-03-10) and two items from
order 1003 (BMW 320i, 2026-03-12).

</details>

**Question 5a:** This query joins four tables (`customer`, `order`, `vehicle`,
`work_item`). In what order would the query optimizer ideally perform the joins —
and why does the join order not affect the *result*, but does affect *performance*?

> The optimizer would ideally start with customer filtered by name (only 1 row), then join with order, then work_item. The vehicle join is less important here since the plate comes from order directly. The join order does not affect the result because joins are commutative and associative which means that the final set of matching rows is always the same regardless of order.
> It does though affect performance because starting with a small filtered result (1 customer) means fewer rows to join at each step. Starting with a large table ,on the other hand, would create big intermediate results that would eventually slow down the query.

---

### Task 5b – Total Hours per Mechanic in March 2026

**Task:** For each mechanic, compute the sum of all hours worked on orders whose
date falls in March 2026. Show `mech_name`, `total_hours` (rounded to one decimal
place), and `orders` (the number of distinct orders in which the mechanic had at
least one work item). Sort descending by `total_hours`.

```sql
-- Query 5b:
Huber, Tom|2.8|2
Schulz, P.|2.3|2
```

<details>
<summary>Expected result</summary>

| mech_name  | total_hours | orders |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Huber, Tom | 2.8         | 2      |
| Schulz, P. | 2.3         | 2      |

</details>

**Question 5b:** Using `COUNT(DISTINCT order_no)` counts orders, not items.
What would `COUNT(*)` count instead, and why would the result differ in this
case?

> COUNT(*) would count the number of work item rows.In this case the result would differ because one mechanic can have multiple work items in the same order.

---

### Task 5c – Vehicles with No Repair Order

**Task:** Return the licence plate and model of every vehicle for which
**no** order exists in the database.

Use a set-difference approach with `EXCEPT` and also write an alternative using
`NOT EXISTS`.

```sql
-- Variant 1: EXCEPT
-- Query 5c-1: insert here

-- Variant 2: NOT EXISTS
-- Query 5c-2: insert here
```

<details>
<summary>Expected result</summary>

With the data from Task 4c there are no matches — all three vehicles have at
least one order. Insert a fourth vehicle without an order to test the query:

```sql
INSERT INTO vehicle VALUES ('BOT-ZZ 1', 1, 'Toyota', 'Yaris', 2022);
```

After that, the query should return `BOT-ZZ 1 | Yaris`.

</details>

**Question 5c:** `EXCEPT` and `NOT EXISTS` are logically equivalent — they
always produce the same result. Are there situations where one approach should
be preferred in practice? Consider readability and extensibility.

> EXCEPT is simpler and more readable for straightforward set differences.
> NOT EXISTS is better when the condition is more complex, for example when comparing multiple columns.
> So in conclustion, NOT EXISTS is generally preferred in practice for its flexibility and performance, while EXCEPT is cleaner for simple cases.

## 6 – Reflection

**Question A – Normalization and redundancy:**  
The original flat table had 5 rows and 15 columns. The normalized schema has
5 tables. At which data volume does normalization pay off most — at 5 rows or
at 50,000? Justify with concrete reference to the anomalies from Task 1a.

> *Your answer:*

**Question B – 3NF vs. BCNF:**  
Lecture 04 explains that BCNF is not always dependency-preserving. Is this
relevant for the workshop schema? Would a BCNF decomposition have looked
different from the 3NF decomposition here?

> *Your answer:*

**Question C – Redundant foreign key in `order`:**  
`order` contains both `plate` (FK → `vehicle`) and `cust_no` (FK → `customer`).
Since `vehicle` itself contains `cust_no`, one might argue that `cust_no`
in `order` is redundant and violates 3NF. Is that correct? When would such
a deliberate denormalization be justified?

> *Your answer:*

**Question D – NULL and order status:**  
An order that has just been created may have no work items yet. What does the
current schema say about this case? Would the schema need to be extended to
correctly represent an order's status (open / completed)? Sketch the necessary
change.

> *Your answer:*

> **Screenshot 4:** Take a screenshot showing the output of Query 5b directly
> in `sqlite3` (with `.headers on` and `.mode column` activated).

> `[insert screenshot]`

## Bonus Tasks

1. **Hourly rate history:** Design a schema extension that allows recording a
   mechanic's hourly rate historically — i.e. which rate applied at the time a
   specific order was processed. Write the modified `CREATE TABLE` statements.

2. **Spare parts:** The workshop also charges for parts in addition to labour.
   Extend the schema with a `part` table and a `order_part` join table that
   records which parts were used in which order. Maintain normal form and
   referential integrity.

3. **Total invoice per order:** Write a query that computes the total amount for
   each order: the sum of `hours × hourly_rate` across all work items. Which
   tables need to be joined?

4. **GitHub Actions:** Add a workflow file `.github/workflows/release.yml` that
   installs PlantUML, renders `schema.puml` to `schema.svg`, and publishes it
   as a release artifact on every `v*` tag. Trigger a release with
   `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`.
